		ADD,	//add (add the top two values of the stack and push the result to the stack, the added values will be removed)
		SUB,	//sub
		MUL,	
		DIV,
		MOV,	//MOV $register0 $register1
		SET,	//SET $register $num
		CMP,	//CMP $stack[top-1] $stack[top]
		IF,	//IF $register $statement [$jump_idx]
		IFN,	//IFN $register $statement [$jump_idx]
		WL,	//WL $register $statement (while)
		WLN,	//(while not)
		LW,	//(end while)
		ELSE
		FI,	//end if
		STR,	//STR $register (set the register's value with the value of the top of stack)
		RTS,	//RTS $register (push the register's value to the top of stack)
		LOG,	//LOG $register (print the value of the $register)
		EXT,	//exit
