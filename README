the name SVM is short for "Shizhan's Virtual Machine".

parser.c parse the code you write into the format the VM can execute,
and the tinyVM.c is the VM itself

by now, the VM has the following instructions:
	PSH,	//push $num (push $num to the stack)
	POP,	//pop (pop the top of the stack)
	ADD,	//add (add the top two values of the stack and push the result to the stack, the added values will be removed)
	SUB,	//sub
	MUL,	
	DIV,
	MOV,	//MOV $register0 $register1
	SET,	//SET $register $num
	IF,	//IF $register $statement [$jump_idx]
	IFN,	//IFN $register $statement [$jump_idx]
	WL,	//WL $register $statement (while)
	WLN,	//(while not)
	LW,	//(end while)
	ELSE
	FI,	//end if
	STR,	//STR $register (set the register's value with the value of the top of stack)
	RTS,	//RTS $register (push the register's value to the top of stack)
	LOG,	//LOG $register (print the value of the $register)
	EXT,	//exit
